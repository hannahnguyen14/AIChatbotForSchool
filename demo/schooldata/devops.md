### What is SHIP-HATS?

**SHIP (Secure Hybrid Integration Pipeline)-HATS (Hive Agile Testing Solutions)** is Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD){:target="_blank"} component within SG Government Tech Stack (SGTS) with security and governance guardrails that enables developers to plan, build, test and deploy code to production.

This is a multi-tenanted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based end-to-end CI/CD for all applications that is classified as RESTRICTED and below.

### Benefits of SHIP-HATS

1. **Policy Compliance:** Standardised development tools and environment that is set up in compliance with **Application Infrastructure Architecture Standard (AIAS)** and **Instruction Manual 8 on Information Technology (IM8)** policies.
2. **Better Quality:** Automated security testing detects vulnerabilities early in the development cycle helping to deliver high quality applications. SHIP-HATS allows agencies to follow prescriptive workflow templates and share knowledge among themselves.
3. **Visibility & Transparency:** Agencies will always have access to source code and hence a better understanding of how the project is progressing.
4. **Shortened Time-to-market:** Agencies can shorten the time to market by leveraging on SHIP-HATS CI/CD tools with predefined & re-usable configurations into their system and do not have to invest in resources/time to do procurement with different commercial providers. Agencies also do not have to invest resources to re-train staff who were re-deployed across agencies.
5. **Economies of Scale:** SHIP-HATS purchases licenses in bulk and redistributes them for use in smaller quantities to agencies and is offered as a complete package with no hidden cost.
6. **GovTech Managed:** The CI/CD tools are procured and managed by GovTech letting you focus on your core application.
7. **Performance Management Dashboard:** Value-Stream Measurement capabilities that allow Agencies to capture key industry metrics, such as lead time to deployment and deployment frequency, to monitor the effectiveness of their DevSecOps practices
